# Python-Notes-Website
this is a python project I coded to learn more about Backend with Python. It's a simple, straighforward notes website where users can sign up, login, create and save notes, and then delete them. It covers Flask, authentication, databases, Jinga2, and more. for this project I followed a Tech with Tim Youtube Tutorial.
I learned a lot of cool things during this project, like writing Python within html files, inheritance in HTML, using a JS function with Python, etc. It was a lot of fun seeing how the website was being slowly put together.
